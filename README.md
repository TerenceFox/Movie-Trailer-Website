# Movie-Trailer-Website
This package takes in data contained in `entertainment_center.py` and structures it according to the class `Movie` in `media.py`. It then uses `fresh_tomatoes.py` to generate an html file containing tiles for each instance of Movie that display its title, poster image, and storyline. When the tile is clicked, the trailer plays in a popover. 

# How To Run 
1. Download the repository
2. In the terminal, navigate to the folder that contains the repository
3. Type `python entertainment_center.py` to run the module
4. The html file will be created and open in a new tab in your web browser
