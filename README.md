# Movie-Trailer-Website
---
This package takes in data contained in `entertainment_center.py` and structures it according to the class `Movie` in `media.py`. It then uses `fresh_tomatoes.py` to generate an html file containing tiles for each instance of Movie that display its title, poster image, and storyline. When the tile is clicked, the trailer plays in a popover. 


# Requirements
---
These files were written with Python 2.7. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 2 like this:

$ sudo apt-get install python2 python2-pip

For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, packages are available at
